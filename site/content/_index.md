    With a military background I am professional and mature but not afraid to
    have fun. For a young energetic person, I have an unusual amount of real
    world leadership and teamwork experience, and I am not straight out of
    college.


    Outdoor Adventure has been a big part of my life. As a Royal Air Force
    Cadet, I developed a love for the outdoors, from hill walking challenges on
    Dartmoor to Sea Kayaking in Cornwall and expeditions to South Africa, I made
    the most of my five years in the Cadets, developing practical skills,
    experience and resilience, unusual for someone my age.


    But sailing is my future. It started with family flotilla then bareboat
    charter holidays and has grown into a passion for water sports and yachting.
    I have worked a full season as a water sports instructor on the Costa Brava
    gaining industry experience before gaining my Yachtmaster qualifications
    with the

    UKSA. The ocean is where I belong.

  heading: Our values
  text: >-
    Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too – one
    of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives. We
    want to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s
    exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature.
